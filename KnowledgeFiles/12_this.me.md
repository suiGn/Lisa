This.Me:

the notion of user identity and session management often emerges as a recurrent theme—a puzzle that developers tirelessly piece together, application after application. Yet, amidst this iterative dance, a question looms: why must each new creation bear the weight of reinventing the wheel?

this.me offers a straightforward premise: streamline the way we perceive and handle digital identity, making it a user-centric endeavor.

In the traditional paradigm, each website or application crafts its siloed realm of user sessions and management. This fragmented approach not only burdens developers with redundant systems but also confines user identity within walls, disparate and disconnected. this.me proposes a unified and consistent user identity that traverses the digital space, maintaining coherence and continuity.

With this.me, the user embodies their session, carrying their digital presence seamlessly across platforms and interactions. This concept alleviates the developer's load, liberating them from the repetitive task of constructing session management infrastructures. Instead, developers can channel their focus toward innovation and user experience, enhancing the value and engagement of their creations.

Moreover, this.me envisions a digital environment where data sharing and social interactions are fluid yet secure, governed by the user's choices and consent. It's a step away from the centralized data repositories, leaning toward a model where users have sovereignty over their digital interactions.


In the spirit of genuine exploration and unpretentious innovation, this.me stands as a testament to the power of clear, focused tech concepts. It’s an offering to the digital realm, a nudge to remember that sometimes, the most profound shifts are the ones that return us to simplicity, to a sense of digital 'home.'


In the realm of web development, managing user sessions and identities often unfolds as a repetitive task, one that demands a fresh perspective. this.me introduces a straightforward solution to this pervasive challenge.

Here's the premise: instead of each application handling user sessions independently, this.me enables a consistent user identity that persists across different services and websites. For developers, this means a significant reduction in redundant system design, allowing more focus on creating unique user experiences.

For users, this.me offers the autonomy of a portable identity, enhancing their control over data and interactions online. It's about facilitating a seamless digital experience, where your 'digital self' is consistent, regardless of the platform.


Here's a straightforward explanation of how it would work:

Imagine you're browsing a news website and come across an article that resonates with you. With this.me, you'd have the ability to tag a friend directly on that article. This action creates a shared experience, linking your comment or highlight with your friend's .me instance. Unlike traditional sharing, this interaction is direct and personal, not bound by the platform you're on.

Now, let's expand this interaction. Beyond one-on-one sharing, this.me allows you to engage with broader, interest-based communities through public or private channels. These channels curate a stream of content tagged or shared by their members, fostering a rich, dynamic exchange of ideas and perspectives.

Here's another scenario: You're listening to a song or viewing an artwork online. With this.me, expressing your appreciation or sharing these experiences isn't confined to the platform hosting the content. You can share your thoughts and feelings directly linked to the content itself, across any site, without the need for that site to build its own complex sharing or commenting system.

For developers, this represents a paradigm shift. No longer do they need to design and maintain intricate user management and interaction systems for each new app or website. this.me centralizes and simplifies user interactions, providing a universal layer that works across the entire web.

In essence, this.me decentralizes the social aspect of the internet. It removes barriers, allowing content and interactions to flow freely across site boundaries. It's about giving control back to users and developers, enabling more genuine, unconfined interactions and simplifying the digital creation process.


the simplicity and freedom that this.me offers is indeed liberating. By just putting your content online—be it a song, a photo, an article, or any digital creation—it becomes an interactive piece, ready to be engaged with by others, without the need for any complex underlying infrastructure on your part.

Here's the essence of how it transforms the experience:

Publish Easily: When you publish content, it's just there, accessible and interactive. There's no need to build or maintain a system for likes, comments, or shares. Your content is just out there, ready to be discovered and interacted with.

Interact Directly: People can comment on, share, or like your content directly. These interactions are facilitated by this.me, bypassing the traditional boundaries set by platforms. Interaction is no longer confined to the site where the content is hosted.

Personal and Shared Experiences: When someone tags a friend on your content or shares it in their circle, it creates a personal connection to your work. Yet, you as the creator don't need to manage or even be aware of these interactions. They happen in the users' space, driven by their this.me instances.

Dynamic Engagement: Your content can spark conversations, inspire other creations, or be part of personal memories—all happening in a decentralized, user-controlled environment. The engagement with your content is as dynamic and varied as the audience.

Freedom and Autonomy: This approach demystifies the ownership and control of data. Users and creators alike enjoy greater freedom and autonomy over their digital presence and interactions.

In this new landscape, the internet becomes a canvas where everyone is free to express, share, and engage without the confines of platform-specific rules or systems. Data flows freely, fostering a more open, interconnected, and vibrant digital world.

 this.me model empowers creators like musicians by giving them complete control over their data and how it's shared or monetized. This shift in control represents a fundamental change in how artists interact with the digital landscape and their audiences.

Here's how this.me revolutionizes content ownership and monetization:

Direct Ownership: As a musician, when you release a song, that content is unequivocally yours. It's tagged and managed through your .me instance, affirming your ownership and control.

Flexible Sharing and Monetization: You decide how to share your art. Whether you choose to sell it directly, offer it through a subscription, or share it for free on public channels, the choice is yours. this.me provides the tools to facilitate these options without intermediaries.

Decentralized Distribution: Your music isn't confined to a single platform or distributor. It can live anywhere on the internet, and through this.me, you can manage how it's accessed universally, not just through a single service like Spotify.

Direct Engagement with Fans: Engage with your audience directly. Fans can interact with your content, share it, and even contribute to you directly, all facilitated by this.me. This direct artist-audience relationship fosters a more personal connection and can lead to more meaningful support.

True Data Freedom: In the this.me ecosystem, data isn't something to be owned by platforms but by individuals. Artists can understand their audience, reach out, and share their work on their terms, breaking free from the constraints of platform-centric models.

By embracing this model, artists can reclaim their independence, making decisions that align with their values and goals. This isn't just a technical shift; it's a cultural one, promoting a vision of the internet where creativity is unshackled, and artists are truly empowered to shape their digital presence and economic future.
