# **MonadLisa Production Setup Overview**

The MonadLisa system leverages the robust "all.this" library from neurons.me, which forms the core of its functionality. Within this ecosystem, we utilize a specialized package known as "this.atom" to manage Electron applications, providing a solid foundation for the MonadLisa's operational structure.

**Cloud Infrastructure and Virtualization**

For the production deployment of MonadLisa, we have chosen a virtual machine hosted on Google Cloud Platform. This environment offers the flexibility and scalability essential for our operations, including the use of wildcard subdomains, which simplifies the management of our gateway and enhances our network architecture.

**Decentralized Identity Management**

A key component in our setup is "cleaker," a decentralized identifier (DID) system. It functions by taking a class, hashing it, and generating a DID. However, the DID's utility is magnified when integrated with "cleaker.me." For instance, a username like "jabellae.cleaker.me" represents a "THIS.ME" identity, where "jabellae" is the username associated with specific identity information. This identity is then "cleaked" into the "cleaker.me" network, establishing a verifiable presence and authenticity within this digital ecosystem.

**Identity Validation Process**

The process for affirming identity validity involves creating a detailed "this.me" profile, which includes information such as name, last name, birthdate, username, and network, alongside a password. This data generates a hash that is stored and matched within "cleaker.me" for validation. If the hash matches, it confirms that the "this.me" profile is the legitimate owner of the corresponding username within the "cleaker.me" network. Any discrepancy in the hash indicates a mismatch in ownership, safeguarding identity integrity within the network.

In summary, the MonadLisa setup on a Google Cloud virtual machine not only capitalizes on the advanced features of cloud infrastructure but also integrates sophisticated identity verification mechanisms to ensure secure and authenticated user interactions within the neurons.me ecosystem.

The setup you've described for the MonadLisa infrastructure involves using Nginx as a reverse proxy and NetGet as the gateway, aiming to efficiently route and secure network traffic. Here's a breakdown of how this process works and the steps involved in implementing such a system:

### DNS Configuration:

- **Primary Goal:** To dynamically route traffic for `main.netget.me` and its associated domains/subdomains without manual updates for each DNS change.
- **CNAME Records:** They are utilized to alias multiple domains to `main.netget.me`, facilitating easy redirection of traffic without altering DNS settings for each domain individually.
- **A Records and ALIAS Records:** While CNAME records are versatile, they can't be used for apex domains. For these, A records or ALIAS records (if available) are employed to point directly to the IP address of the server.

### Nginx as a Reverse Proxy:

- **Function:** Nginx intercepts incoming HTTP requests to various domains/subdomains and routes them to the appropriate destination, in this case, the MonadLisa application.
- **Configuration:** Nginx is configured with server blocks to handle requests for the main domain and to pattern-match any subdomains, using `proxy_pass` to direct traffic internally.
- **Wildcard and Regex Support:** Nginx supports wildcard server names and regular expressions, enabling it to process requests for dynamic subdomains efficiently.

### SSL Certificates with Let's Encrypt:

- **Objective:** To secure all traffic using SSL certificates, ensuring encrypted connections (HTTPS) for all domains and subdomains.
- **Wildcard SSL Certificates:** Let's Encrypt can issue wildcard certificates that cover the main domain and all subdomains, simplifying SSL management.
- **Certbot Integration:** Certbot or a similar ACME client automates certificate issuance and renewal, including configuring Nginx to serve the necessary ACME challenge responses for domain verification.

### Dynamic Certificate Generation:

- **Automation:** When new domains or subdomains are added and pointed to your server, the system should automatically initiate a certificate generation process.
- **Integration:** Embedding ACME client operations into your domain management workflow allows for on-the-fly SSL certificate setup for newly added domains.

### Scalability and Reliability:

- **Load Balancing:** Implementing a load balancer enhances the distribution of incoming traffic across multiple servers, promoting system reliability and scalability.
- **Cloud-Based Load Balancers:** Utilizing advanced cloud load balancing solutions can offer additional benefits like automated SSL management, DDoS protection, and CDN services.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Domain Configuration:** Establish CNAME records for subdomains and A/ALIAS records for apex domains to point to your central server.
2. **Nginx Setup:** Configure server blocks for domain and subdomain traffic handling, ensuring requests are routed to the correct local services or applications.
3. **SSL Configuration:** Automate SSL certificate management using Let's Encrypt, setting up Certbot to handle renewals and Nginx configuration updates.

By following this structured approach, you can create a robust, secure, and scalable MonadLisa production en

-------

let's refine the explanation to focus on the more general use case of NetGet with Nginx, without tying it specifically to `main.netget.me` unless necessary for context. The setup described can indeed be applied to any public IP address where Nginx is configured to listen and handle traffic, facilitating the dynamic routing and management of domains and subdomains through NetGet.

### Generalized NetGet and Nginx Setup:

**Overview:** The setup involves Nginx functioning as a reverse proxy, which intercepts HTTP requests to any configured domain or subdomain and forwards them to the appropriate service, in this case, the MonadLisa application. NetGet acts as the centralized gateway, managing these routing rules and SSL configurations.

### Nginx as a Reverse Proxy:

- **Functionality:** Nginx listens on a public IP address and is configured to manage incoming traffic for multiple domains/subdomains, directing requests to their respective endpoints within the internal network or services.
- **Dynamic Routing:** By utilizing server blocks and possibly leveraging regular expressions or wildcard entries, Nginx can dynamically route requests based on the hostname, enabling the handling of numerous domains and subdomains without the need for individual configuration for each.

### SSL Encryption:

- **Universal SSL:** The use of Let's Encrypt for generating SSL certificates ensures that all traffic managed by Nginx is encrypted, regardless of the specific domain or subdomain. Wildcard certificates can be particularly effective for covering multiple subdomains under a single domain.
- **Automation:** Automating SSL certificate issuance and renewal with tools like Certbot ensures continuous encryption without manual intervention. This includes dynamically updating Nginx's configuration to serve new certificates as they are generated or renewed.

### Scalability and Flexibility:

- **Adaptability:** This setup is designed to be adaptable to new domains or subdomains being added to the system. The combination of DNS configuration, Nginx's dynamic routing capabilities, and automated SSL management allows for a scalable and flexible system that can grow with your needs.
- **Load Balancing:** To further enhance scalability and reliability, a load balancer can be introduced to distribute incoming traffic across multiple Nginx servers or instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

### Implementation Steps for a General Setup:

1. **DNS Configuration:** Use DNS records to direct traffic for your domains and subdomains to the public IP address where Nginx is listening.
2. **Nginx Configuration:** Set up Nginx to handle incoming requests, using server blocks to route traffic to the correct services and applying SSL certificates to secure connections.
3. **SSL Management:** Integrate Let's Encrypt with Nginx to automate the process of acquiring and renewing SSL certificates, ensuring all managed traffic is encrypted.

By adopting this approach, you create a robust and flexible infrastructure where Nginx and NetGet work in concert to manage and secure network traffic across a potentially vast array of domains and subdomains, all while maintaining ease of management and scalability.

Users or developers interacting with your MonadLisa network or those setting up their own instances of MonadLisa do not need‚Äîand should not have‚Äîaccess to your LisaMemory database credentials. Here's how the separation works:

### For Users of Your Network:

- **Access Without Credentials**: Users accessing services provided by your MonadLisa do so through the interfaces you expose (APIs, web interfaces, etc.). They interact with your network without needing direct access to the backend database, ensuring your data remains secure and isolated.
- **Service Consumption**: They use the functionalities and data offered by your network as end-users. Any data retrieval or manipulation is handled by your application logic, which then interacts with LisaMemory based on the predefined rules and access controls you've established.

### For Developers Setting Up Their Own MonadLisa:

- **Independent Databases**: Developers who wish to set up their own instances of MonadLisa will create and manage their databases. They'll use their credentials for their instances, ensuring complete independence from your LisaMemory database.
- **Schema Replication**: You might provide them with the database schema or migration scripts, enabling them to replicate the necessary structure in their databases. This facilitates a smooth setup process for their MonadLisa instances without any overlap or direct connection to your LisaMemory.

### Ensuring Data Isolation and Security:

- **Documentation**: Make it clear in your documentation that users and developers do not need (and will not receive) access to your database credentials. Emphasize that your database is solely for the official MonadLisa network and that others should set up their databases.
- **Security Practices**: Continue to follow best practices for security, ensuring that access to your LisaMemory database is tightly controlled and that only authorized operations are allowed through your application's logic.

By maintaining this separation, you ensure that your MonadLisa network remains secure and that others can develop with or use your tools without compromising the integrity and privacy of the data stored in LisaMemory. This approach fosters a healthy ecosystem where your network can serve users effectively, and developers can build upon or with MonadLisa in their environments.

###  Deployment and Documentation

Ensure that for any deployment or distribution, you provide instructions for users to set their `.env` files based on `.env.example`. This step is crucial for maintaining the security and flexibility of your application's configuration.

--------

Setting up your environment for MonadLisa involves configuring various components to work together seamlessly. The `env.example` file you've provided outlines the necessary environment variables that need to be configured for your application to connect to its required services correctly. Here's how you can use this example to create a `.env` file for the proper environment configuration and how to start MonadLisa:

### Setting Up the `.env` File:

1. **Database Configuration:**

   - Copy the `env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.

   - Replace the placeholders in the 

     ```
     .env
     ```

      file with your actual database configuration details:

     - `DB_HOST`: The hostname of your database server (e.g., `localhost` or an IP address).
     - `DB_PORT`: The port your database listens on (e.g., `5432` for PostgreSQL).
     - `DB_USER`: The username used to access your database.
     - `DB_PASSWORD`: The password associated with your database user.
     - `DB_NAME`: The name of the database where `LisaMemory` resides.

2. **Service Configuration:**

   - `NETGET_PORT`: Define the port on which NetGet should listen, e.g., `3000`.
   - `DOMAINS_CONFIG_PATH`: Specify the path to your `domains.json` file, which contains the domain configurations for NetGet.

3. **Additional Configurations:**

   - Define any additional environment variables you might need, like `API_KEYS` or external service URLs, following the same format.

### Configuring Nginx to Use Environment Variables:

While Nginx does not natively support `.env` files, you can export environment variables in the environment Nginx runs in. For example, you could set these variables in the same script or service configuration that starts Nginx. However, for Nginx to make use of specific environment variables, you would typically inject these values into your Nginx configuration template and use a pre-processor to replace placeholders with the actual environment values before starting Nginx.

### Starting MonadLisa:

1. **Import Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that your `index.js` file imports necessary dependencies and modules, as shown in your code snippet.
2. **Database Connection:**
   - The `createPool` function initializes the database connection using the environment variables set in your `.env` file.
3. **NetGet Gateway Configuration:**
   - Instantiate a `Gateway` object with the configuration options pulled from the environment variables.
4. **Start the Gateway:**
   - Call `gateway.listen()` to start the NetGet gateway, which will begin listening for incoming requests on the configured port.
5. **Running the Application:**
   - To start MonadLisa, you can use a command like `node index.js` in your terminal, assuming all dependencies are installed and environment variables are set.

By following these steps, you configure and start your MonadLisa application with the correct environment settings, ensuring that it can interact with its database and manage incoming requests through the NetGet gateway.
