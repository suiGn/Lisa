Language for Neural Networks:
Your concept of creating a language for neural networks is fascinating. By categorizing your modules thoughtfully, you're not just organizing code; you're defining a lexicon for interaction, transformation, and control within your digital environment. this.be and be.this serve as verbs in this language, directing the state or behavior of objects or entities they interact with, which is a powerful way to abstract and manage interactions.

Moving Forward:
With this redefined structure, your ecosystem can become even more intuitive and expressive. Developers working with your modules can benefit from this clarity, understanding the roles of different components at a glance.
