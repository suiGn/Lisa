# Lisa

Lisa is a GPT digital assistant designed to provide information, facilitate understanding, and assist with tasks within the MonadLisa and neurons.me ecosystem, constantly evolving to better serve and interact.

GPT Training Integration: In the context of GPT training, Lisa can act as a container or interface for specific sets of knowledge or functionalities. This could mean that when Lisa is used in training, it can dynamically access and provide the necessary data from the knowledge files, enhancing the training process with context-specific intelligence.

Standalone Node Module: As a Node module, Lisa can be imported into any Node.js application, providing external applications with access to its methods and, potentially, to the underlying knowledge files. This opens up possibilities for developers to use Lisa's functionalities, including data retrieval, processing, and any other logic you embed within its methods.

------------
Lisa module is currently in a dynamic phase of development and exploration, aimed at refining its functionalities and maximizing its utility both as a GPT training tool and a standalone Node.js module. As such, it is subject to significant changes and enhancements in the near future. Users and developers are encouraged to engage with the module, keeping in mind that its current features and capabilities are evolving. This developmental stage is crucial for adapting Lisa to a wide range of use cases and for ensuring that it meets the high standards required for both GPT training applications and external Node.js module integrations.

# Knowledge Files Repository for Lisa GPT Training
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-BY3XQyZNR-lisa

## Introduction
Welcome to the Knowledge Files Repository, a dedicated space within our GPTS framework designed to store and organize the markdown files that serve as training material for our Generative Pre-trained Transformer models. This repository plays a crucial role in shaping the intelligence and effectiveness of our GPT models by providing them with a rich and structured set of knowledge files.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to curate and maintain a collection of markdown files that are instrumental in training and refining GPTS models. These files encompass a wide range of topics and domains, offering a comprehensive knowledge base for the models to learn from and interact with.

## Repository Structure
- **Main.md**: This document acts as the entry point to the repository. It provides an overview of the knowledge files contained within and serves as a guide to navigate through the various documents, ensuring quick and efficient access to the relevant content.

- **Knowledge Files**: Each `.md` file within the repository is structured to facilitate easy ingestion by GPTS models. These files are crafted and organized meticulously to ensure that the models can derive meaningful patterns, context, and insights from the content.

## Using the Repository
- **Training GPTS Models**: The markdown files in this repository are utilized to train GPTS models, enabling them to acquire knowledge, understand context, and generate responses based on the information contained within these files.

- **Reference and Research**: Beyond model training, these files can also serve as a reference point for researchers and developers looking to understand the knowledge base of the models or to contribute to the repository.

- **Contribution**: Contributors are encouraged to add to and enhance the knowledge files, ensuring that the GPTS models remain up-to-date with the latest information and insights across various domains.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions to the knowledge files. If you wish to contribute, please ensure that your submissions are well-structured, coherent, and relevant to the GPTS training objectives. 

## Final Note
This repository is in continuous development, reflecting the evolving nature of knowledge and information. As the GPTS models grow and adapt, so too will the content and structure of this repository, ensuring that our models remain at the forefront of AI research and application.

Join us in this exciting journey to empower GPTS with a profound and expansive knowledge base, paving the way for more intelligent and context-aware generative models.
